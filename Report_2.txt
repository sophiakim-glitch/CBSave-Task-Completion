Report 2: Core Application Development -> Complete

  Project Structure:
    - Created complete folder hierarchy:
        - app/   --> main application code
        - app/routers/     --> API endpoints
        - app/middleware/ --> security and logging
        - app/utils/    --> helper functions
        - test/    --> testing suite
        - requirements/    --> dependency management
        - docker/     --> containerization
        - infrastructure/     --> Terraform for AWS

  Dependenciies Installed:
    - Fast API (web framework)
    - SQLAlchemy (database ORM)
    - Pydantic (data validation)
    - Uvicorn (ASGI server)
    - Psycopg2-binary (PostgreSQL driver)
    - Memurai Client
    - Passlib, Python-jose (security libraries)
    - boto3 (AWS SDK)
    - pytest (testing framework)
    - black, flake8, mypy  (code quality tools)

  Database Schema:
    - Designed complete database schema
    - Created 7 core tables:
        - business_categories - Business type classification
        - businesses - Registered merchant accounts
        - customers - tracked customer records (PII hashed)
        - chargebacks - chargeback transaction records
        - screening_logs - API screening attempt logs
        - credit_transactions - Billing and payment tracking
        - audit_logs - security audit trail
    - Implemeneted 15+ database indexes for performance optimization
    - Set up foreign key relationships and referential integrity
    - added data validation constraints (CHECK constraints)
    - Configured cascading deletes for data consistency

Configuration Management (app.config.py):
  - Implemeneted centralized settings using Pydantic
  - Environment-based configuration (dev/staging/prod)
  - Secure credential management
  - Database connection pooling configuration
  - Rate limiting settings
  - CORS policy configuration
  - AWS integration settings

Security Layer (app/security.py):
  - SHA-256 hashing for customer PII (email, phone, names)
  - Cryptographically secure API key generation (64-character)
  - API key hashing for secure storage
  - customer risk grade calculation algorithm (1X-5X)
  - Automated blocking logic (blocks 3X+ = 4+ chargebacks or more)
  - Input validation and format verification

Database Connection Layer (app/database.py):
  - Production-grade connection pooling (20 connections, 10 overflow)
  - Automatic connection health checks (pre-ping)
  - Connection recycling (prevent stale connections)
  - Transaction management with automatic rollback
  - Context managers for safe database operations
  - Database health check function for monitoring
  - Comprehensive error logging

Data Models (app/models.py):
  - Created 7 SQLAlchemy ORM models matching database schema
  - Implemented automatic timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
  - Set up bidirectional relationshisp between models
  - UUID primary keys for security and scalability
  - JSONB support for flexible metadata storage
  - Cascade delete configurations for data integrity
  - Comprehensive indexing strategy

API Schemas (app/schemas.py):
  - Created 20+ Pydantic validation schemas
  - Input validation for all API endpoints
  - Response formatting schemas
  - Custom validators (email/phone requirement, business name format)
  - Field constraints (min/max length, positive numbers)
  - Type safety for all data transfers

Basic Fast API Application (app/main.py):
  - Created FastAPI application with proper configuration
  - Implemented CORS middleware 
  - Added root endpoint (API information)
  - Added health check endpoint (for monitoring)
  - Added API info endpoint
  - Configured interactive documentation (Swagger UI)
  - Set up alternative documentation (ReDoc)

Testing & Verification:
  - Verified database connection
  - Tested model creation and relationships
  - Verified API key generation
  - Tested customer hashing logic
  - Confirmed grade calculation algorithm
  - Tested all 10 business categories inserted
  - Validated FastAPI server runs successfully
  - Confirmed Interactive API docs accessible
